DESCRIPTION
Verify the quality of the start counter (ST) calibration for the SRC/CT dataset

USAGE
-Update the run list of interest in runs.dat
-Setup the environment: source env.csh
-Run the script: csh scripts_res.csh
-Three output files will be available in the results folder
    1. st_time_plots: includes the timing plots and fit results of each channel of the start counter
    2. st_time_res: a text file of the offsets and resolutions of each channel. The format is column offset offset_uncertainty resolution resolution_uncertainty
    3. st_time_summary: a summary plot of the offset and resolution for all the channels. The format is offset against the channel number, with the error bar being resolution   
-Get a summary of all the runs processed: python summary.py
-The output files are
    1. Saved pictures of the offset and the resolution averaged and per channel across the entire run period
    2. A text file of problematic runs with channel numbers which exceed a specific threshold
