In order to get the average start counter(SC) time resolution from ST_Tresolution plugin, run the plugin over your selected data and get the hd_root.root file.

The macro Resolution.C calculate the SC time resolution after PTC when the RF is determined by a hit in the SC. This macro calculate the time resolution for each paddle and the average time resolution for the SC.

Other macros were used in older versions. I will keep them for some time.
