This is the prpagation time correction plugin which is using the 
CCDB table:  propagation_time_corr

In order to get new set of constants follow the following steps:
1) Run the plugin over your selected data and get the hd_root.root file
2) Run SC_PTC.C plugin in order to get the mean value of the time vz z(mid point of each z interval).
3) Plot the mean value of the time vs Z using SC_PTC_Plot.C macro.
4) The macro in step 3 will do three line fits for the  three specified 
 ranges and write the constants on PTC_1DFits.txt
5) write these constant to the table propagation_time_corr
6) Time resolution can be calculated from this plugin using Resolution.C
7) Time resolution vs Z can be calculated using  SC_PTC_RvsZ.C, and ploted by using  SC_PTC_ResolvsZPlot.C.

There are couple of macros were used in older versions of this calibration. I will keep them for some time.
